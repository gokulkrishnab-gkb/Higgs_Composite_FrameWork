# Higgs_Composite_FrameWork
This is a project under development , where we deal with the composte higgs framewrok and try to see it's analysis implementation using different algorithms such as BDT,DNN and conventional cut and count
<br/>

Model UFO File. : HC_FormFactor:1.zip <br/>

The model information can be found in the reference : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01093 <br/>

The Model is implemented and UFO is attached HC_FormFactor:1.zip <br/>

To Showcase the analysis , we have created two dataset which is extracted from .root file <br/>
The process which we have studies is P P > Z H , ( Z > l+ l- ) , ( H > b b~ )

Step 1 : Extraction of Particle information from the .root file is implemented. The Kinematic variables of our interest are , PT(l+),PT(l-),PT(b),DeltaR(l+,l-),M(l+,l-),M(l+l-bb~) <br/>
